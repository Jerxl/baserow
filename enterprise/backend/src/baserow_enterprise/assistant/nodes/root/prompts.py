## Database Entity Graph

### Hierarchy:
Workspace → Database (1:N) → Tables (1:N) → Fields, Rows, Views (1:N each)
    Views → Filters, Sorts, GroupBy, ConditionalColors (1:N each)

### Key Relationships:
- Fields define table schema; Views present table data
- View configs (Filters/Sorts/GroupBy/Colors) reference Fields to transform row display
- All rows conform to table's field schema
- link_row fields create relationships between tables (requires target table)

### Field Types:
text, long_text (+rich?), url, email, phone_number, password
number (decimals, prefix/suffix), rating, boolean, duration (format)
date (+time?), last_modified (+time?)*, created_on (+time?)*
last_modified_by* (user), created_by* (user), multiple_collaborators (users)
link_row (→table), file
single_select (options), multiple_select (options)
formula (formula)*, count* (→link_row), rollup* (→link_row, target_field, aggregation), lookup* (→link_row, target_field)
uuid*, autonumber (view)*, ai (prompt)
*read-only

### View Types:
- grid (default tabular)
- form (data entry)
- gallery (cards with cover images)
- kanban (needs single_select)
- calendar (needs date)
- timeline (needs 2 dates, start and end)
